TODO:

	- optimization: if something is not being affected for a while, stop simulating it

	- stepframes: make it so step can step a certain customizeable amount of frames

	- custom editor settings like color scheme, etc

	- make it so you cannot change audio file while audio is playing in editor via dev play

	- bug: there is some instability when dealing with entt handles between int to uint32_t conversions	

	- integrate SPIR-V shaders

	- all TODOs

	- audio and texture dropboxes should always do relative, not absolute

	- custom shaders, post processing, materials

	- script choose popup reactor to include search, filter, namespace organization, etc

	- audio on separate thread and better clean up after playing sounds

	- implement layers

	- allow users to tweak the attenuation curve, etc (https://indiegamedev.net/2020/04/12/the-complete-guide-to-openal-with-c-part-3-positioning-sounds/)

	- particle system

	- audio hard disk streaming support

	- audio mp3 support

	- vfx graph

	- undo and redo

	- text rendering!

	- layout system

	- networking

	- optimization for multithreading!

	- optick profiler

	- overhaul animations to include things like flags and extra functionality, or even calling functions on certain frames

	- content browser select multiple

	- startup splash screen oooooo

	- texture hot reloading

	- more texture support

	- multi-threaded auto saving

	- circle physics collider visual consistent line width

1.0 RELEASE:

	- audio properly pause during scene simulation pause

	- no paths ANYWHERE in code should be plain text, should be all dynamic and in variables

	- open visual studio button

	- refactor content browser panel popup

	- simplify popup menus (New __ options should be condensed into an expandable "New..")

	- support distrubution (custom formats)

	- move some editor settings to scene settings (like editor camera) or separate it into a sceneEditorSetting file specific to scene

	- move editor dependent assets into resources folder

	- bug: gpu monitoring doesn't really work depending on graphics card

	- sprites should have the option to linear filter or not

	- bug: gpu not being detected in stats dynamically

	- bug: moving rotation on subentities affects the scale

	- bug: physics don't work perfectly when it comes to sub-entities - something is affecting scale

	- bug: offset circle collider is kinda weird, are we sure we're using the body transform and not the entity transform during physics simulation?

	- redo flpch

	- openAL needs to be installed or else OpenAL32.dll not found error will appear

	- redo includes, .h should be relative, everything else absolute

	- get rid of all flora warnings

	- refactor classes / reorder them to they're just neater and more readable

	- documentation?

	- should scripts be before or after physics calculations?

	- refactor some things to use component group so we only have one place we need to add a new component to

	- refine copy and paste

	- update scripting engine with audio components

	- script hot reloading should detect when save file even on not runtime and update serialized fields in properties panel instantly!

	- clean github

	- optimize type dependent script field functionality (use switch case stuff, make it just easier to add in new)

	- stabalize entity id to use uint32_t always, and 0 is an invalid entity

	- make a public static activescene 

	- scriptengine needs to reload and correct the assemblies whenever the project changes or even a new one is created

	- scriptengine assembly needs to be created on load somehow

	- renaming a project will cause opening the visual studio project to break since the visual studio project file needs to be renamed as well or rebuilt

	- highlight selected entity probably shouldnt be white

	- highlight selected entity doesnt take in account sub entities

	- clicking on entity before pressing enter on a field can effect that entity despite it being supposed to be assigned to the entity prior to clicking on a new one


IN PROGRESS:

IMPLEMENTED TICKETS:
	- show grid

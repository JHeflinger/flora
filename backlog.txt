TODO:

	- optimization: if something is not being affected for a while, stop simulating it

	- custom editor settings like color scheme, etc

	- bug: there is some instability when dealing with entt handles between int to uint32_t conversions

	- integrate SPIR-V shaders

	- implement projects

	- custom shaders, post processing, materials

	- implement layers
	
	- c# scripting

	- reflection system (serialize values and show them in properties panel!)

	- particle system

	- gravity

	- vfx graph

	- undo and redo

	- text rendering!

	- layout system

	- standalone runtime and standalone serialization

	- audio

	- networking

	- optimization for multithreading!

	- simplify popup menus (New __ options should be condensed into an expandable "New..")

	- optick profiler

	- support distrubution (custom formats)

	- overhaul animations to include things like flags and extra functionality, or even calling functions on certain frames

	- make native scripting more stable

	- project settings?

	- move some editor settings to scene settings (like editor camera) or separate it into a sceneEditorSetting file specific to scene

	- content browser select multiple 

	- copy and paste can select multiple files/entities

	- move editor dependent assets into a protected assets folder

	- startup splash screen oooooo

	- bug: gpu monitoring doesn't really work depending on graphics card

	- add hardware monitoring error handling

	- sprites should have the option to linear filter or not

	- show hitbox option on collider body

	- texture hot reloading

	- more texture support

	- bug: moving rotation on subentities affects the scale

	- bug: physics don't work perfectly when it comes to sub-entities - something is affecting scale

IN PROGRESS:

	- show camera view box

	- label component

	- line stats

	- serialize editor settings for physics collider lines on/off/and thickness

IMPLEMENTED TICKETS:

	- serialize editor settings for turning on circle and line stats

	- lines rendering

	- bug: z-index blending isnt working correctly

	- bug: click to select doesn't always work

	- add circle to stats

	- circle rendering

	- dev input in console panel

	- bug: content browser would not update scene filepath when renaming scene

	- physics wrapper to add vectors and etc

	- asset manager so a new texture won't be used for every entity that uses that texture

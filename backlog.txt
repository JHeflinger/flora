TODO:

	- custom editor settings like color scheme, etc

	- integrate SPIR-V shaders

	- implement projects

	- custom shaders, post processing, materials

	- implement layers
	
	- c# scripting

	- reflection system (serialize values and show them in properties panel!)

	- box2D

	- particle system

	- gravity

	- vfx graph

	- undo and redo

	- asset manager so a new texture won't be used for every entity that uses that texture

	- text rendering!

	- layout system

	- standalone runtime and standalone serialization

	- audio

	- networking

	- optimization for multithreading!

	- optick profiler

	- support distrubution (custom formats)

	- overhaul animations to include things like flags and extra functionality, or even calling functions on certain frames

	- make native scripting more stable

	- project settings?

	- move some editor settings to scene settings (like editor camera) or separate it into a sceneEditorSetting file specific to scene

	- content browser select multiple 

	- copy and paste can select multiple files/entities

IN PROGRESS:

	- 2d physics

	- sprites should have the option to linear filter or not

	- runtime performance in stats panel (cpu/gpu usage, temp, etc)

	- move editor dependent assets into a protected assets folder

	- need to be able to get entity from tag

	- simplify popup menus (New __ options should be condensed into an expandable "New..")

	- make a more efficient way to ensure only one camera is primary

IMPLEMENTED TICKETS:

	- spdlogged errors should automatically open up a popup

	- added axis minimum and axis scalar settings to stat panel
